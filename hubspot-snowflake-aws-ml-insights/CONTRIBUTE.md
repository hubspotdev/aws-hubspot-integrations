# Communication

HubSpot Developer Relations strongly advises all contributors and maintainers of this project to uphold a respectful and inclusive community. We are committed to treating all individuals who contribute, report issues, post feature requests, update documentation, submit pull requests or patches, and engage in other project activities respectfully and openly.

## Issues & Troubleshooting

If you have questions about installing, running, or troubleshooting [HubSpot](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/overview) or [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/), please first refer to the technical documentation. If the documentation doesn't address your question(s), you can ask for help on the [HubSpot Developer Slack](https://developers.hubspot.com/slack). If you believe you've discovered a bug or would like to contribute to this project, please submit an issue.

## Contribution

The first step to contributing to a DevRel project is to find something to work on. Help is always welcome, and no contribution is too small (see below)!

Here are some things you can do today to get started contributing:

*   Clarify code, variables, or functions that can be renamed or commented on
*   Write test coverage
*   Help triage existing issues

If the above suggestions don’t appeal to you, you can browse the issues to see who is looking for help or what features still need to be added.
